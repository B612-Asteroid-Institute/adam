# Writing an initial Developer Wiki and Guide

Authors: @mjuric, @jp-c3

## What's been done

We've started creating a wiki on gitub, in which we'll keep information
needed for software development work.  This includes the community
communication guidelines, description of developer infrastructure, and
guidelines for code development.

The result is on:

https://github.com/B612-Asteroid-Institute/developer-wiki/wiki

and his repository is pinned to the
[B612-Asteroid-Institute](https://github.com/B612-Asteroid-Institute)
organization, to make it easy to find.

We created the initial [Developer
Guide](https://github.com/B612-Asteroid-Institute/developer-wiki/wiki/Developer-Guide)
that codifies guidelines for code formatting, development workflow, commit
best practices, testing best practices, and code review. This is the initial
version; more work to be done as people try to use it!

## What to do next

* Add more information about the communication mechanisms and guidelines to
  the wiki
* Continue developing the developer guide
* Present & teach what's in the developer guide
