# Discussions about needed infrastructure

We've discussed what infrastructure would be good to have for the team to
work efficiently on ADAM. A brief summary:

* Move to github sooner rather than later, and begin to use github tools
  - Danica will ask GitHub for free private repositories
* Create a Slack channel and use it
  - Channel created! h/t to Samira.
  - Need to write communication guidelines
* Create an initial developer guide
  - Will be Mario's hack for the day
* Should B612 set up its own JupyterHub?
  - Mario will consult with UW eScience people to see how difficult it is to
    maintain
