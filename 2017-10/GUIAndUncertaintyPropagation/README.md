# GUI for an ADAM propagation call and propagate mean and covariance

Authors: @hawesdb, @vvittaldev

## GUI

### What's been done

Made a GUI where a user can input initial state, epoch, start time, and end time.

The data is sent to the cloud to compute. The final state is shown along with debugging information.

A notebook called InitialGUI has been added to the BitBucket repository.

## Uncertainty Propagation

### What's been done

Made a Jupyter Notebook that takes an inital state and uncertainty of an asteroid and then propagates both the mean and covariance of the asteroid forward in time.

A notebook called UncertaintyPropagation has been added to the BitBucket repository.
