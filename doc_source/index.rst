ADAM Python SDK
===========================================

ADAM (Asteroid Decision, Analysis, and Mapping) is a cloud-based software platform that performs astrodynamics algorithms (e.g. orbit propagation). You can find whitepapers, presentations, etc. `here <https://b612foundation.org/adam>`_.

The ADAM Python SDK (software development kit) provides methods to access the ADAM API as well as perform analysis.
